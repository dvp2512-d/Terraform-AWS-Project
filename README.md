# AWS Two-Tier Web Architecture with Terraform

This Terraform project provisions a highly available, scalable web infrastructure on AWS. It creates a custom VPC environment with public subnets, EC2 instances, a load balancer, and an S3 bucket.


## üöÄ What This Project Does

- **VPC & Subnets**: Custom VPC with two public subnets in different AZs (`us-east-1a` and `us-east-1b`) for high availability.
- **Internet Gateway & Routing**: Enables internet access by associating the route table with an internet gateway.
- **Security Groups**: Allows HTTP (port 80) and SSH (port 22) traffic from any IP.
- **EC2 Instances**: Deploys two `t2.micro` web servers across different subnets, using separate user-data scripts.
- **Load Balancer (ALB)**: Routes HTTP traffic to instances with target group attachment and health checks.
- **S3 Bucket**: Creates a public S3 bucket (optionally for static asset hosting or backups).
- **Output**: Returns the ALB DNS for browser access.
